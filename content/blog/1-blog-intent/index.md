Hey,

I like to learn, explore, and think about many different topics such as statistics, machine learning, complex systems, economics, finance, history, etc. A mental jack of all trades but master of none, of sorts.

I wanted to create this website to serve as an "export" of my brain, at least regarding knowledge that I think are interesting enough to write about and share with folks (like yourself) on the internet.

Enjoy!

John
